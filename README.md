# DCGAT-DTI
**DCGAT-DTI ** is a novel deep learning framework for Drugâ€“Target Interaction (DTI) prediction, designed to enhance drug discovery by dynamically modeling interactions between chemical compounds and proteins. Unlike traditional methods that process drug and protein similarity graphs independently, DCGAT-DTI introduces a **Dynamic Cross-Graph Attention (DCGAT)** module to capture intra- and cross-graph dependencies. It initializes embeddings using pretrained language models (ESM-2 for proteins and ChemBERTa for drugs) and constructs similarity graphs that are processed through a GCN-based **Cross Neighborhood Selection (CNS) network**. This enables dynamic selection of cross-modal neighbors, allowing drug and protein embeddings to integrate information from both modalities via intra- and cross-graph attention mechanisms. A dual-objective training strategy combining binary cross-entropy and **supervised contrastive loss** further improves interaction discrimination. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in cold start scenarios where unseen drugs or proteins are introduced.
